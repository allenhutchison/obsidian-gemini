## Features

- **Agent Mode with Tool Calling:** An AI agent that can actively work with your vault! It can search for files, read content, create new notes, edit existing ones, move and rename files, create folders, and even conduct deep research with proper citations. Features persistent sessions, granular permission controls, and session-specific model configuration.
- **Context-Aware Chat:** Engage in conversations with Gemini AI, with the ability to include the content of your current active note as context. You can manually add other notes (including linked notes) to the context for highly relevant and personalized responses.
- **Smart Summarization:** Quickly generate concise, one-sentence summaries of your notes and automatically store them in the document's frontmatter, using a dedicated Gemini model optimized for summarization.
- **Selection-Based Text Rewriting:** Precisely rewrite any selected text with AI assistance. Simply select the text you want to improve, right-click to choose "Rewrite with Gemini", and provide instructions for how you'd like it rewritten.
- **IDE-Style Completions:** Get real-time, context-aware text completions as you type, similar to IDEs. Accept completions with `Tab` or dismiss with any other key. This feature uses a dedicated Gemini model for optimized completion generation.
- **Markdown-Based Chat History:** Store your chat history directly in your vault as markdown files. Each note's chat history is stored in a separate file in the `gemini-scribe/History/` folder, making it easy to backup, version control, and manage your AI interactions.
- **Configurable Models:** Choose different Gemini models for chat, summarization, and completions, allowing you to tailor the AI's behavior to each task.
- **Custom Prompt System:** Create reusable AI instruction templates that can be applied to individual notes, allowing you to customize the AI's behavior for different types of content (e.g., technical documentation, creative writing, tutoring). Includes command palette commands for easy creation, application, and removal of custom prompts.
- **Built-in Prompt Templates:** The plugin uses carefully crafted Handlebars templates for system prompts, general chat prompts, summarization prompts, selection rewrite prompts, completion prompts, and prompts to include the current date and time. These ensure consistent and effective AI interaction.
- **Data Privacy:** All interactions with the Gemini API are done directly from your machine. No data is sent to any third-party servers other than Google's. Chat history is stored locally in your Obsidian vault as markdown files.
- **Robust History Management:**
  - Per-note history files with automatic linking
  - Automatic handling of file renames and moves
  - Easy backup and version control of chat history
  - Commands to manage and clear history
  - Persistent agent sessions with full conversation history

## Troubleshooting

- **API Key Errors:** Ensure your API key is correct and has the necessary permissions. Get a new key at [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey).
- **No Responses:** Check your internet connection and make sure your API key is valid.
- **Slow Responses:** The speed of responses depends on the Gemini model and the complexity of your request. Larger context windows will take longer.
- **Completions Not Showing:** 
  - Ensure completions are enabled via the command palette
  - Try typing a few words and pausing to trigger the suggestion
  - Check that you're in a Markdown file
  - Disable other completion plugins that might conflict
- **History Not Loading:** Ensure "Enable Chat History" is enabled and the "History Folder" is correctly set.
- **Custom Prompts Not Working:**
  - Ensure "Enable Custom Prompts" is toggled on in settings
  - Verify the prompt file exists in the Prompts folder
  - Check that the wikilink syntax is correct: `[[Prompt Name]]`
  - Try using the command palette commands for easier management
  - See the [Custom Prompts Guide](docs/custom-prompts-guide.md) for detailed troubleshooting
- **Parameter/Advanced Settings Issues:**
  - Check if your model supports the temperature range you're using
  - Reset temperature and Top P to defaults if getting unexpected responses
  - Enable model discovery to get latest parameter limits
  - See the [Advanced Settings Guide](docs/advanced-settings-guide.md) for detailed configuration help
- **Agent Mode / Tool Issues:**
  - Verify your Gemini model supports function calling (all Gemini 2.0+ models do)
  - If tools fail, check file permissions and paths
  - System folders (plugin state folder, .obsidian) are protected from modifications
  - For session issues, try creating a new session from the chat interface
  - Check the console (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + I) for detailed error messages
  - Tool loop detection may stop repeated operations - adjust settings if needed
