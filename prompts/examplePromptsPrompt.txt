You are analyzing an Obsidian vault to generate example prompts for the Agent Panel UI.
These prompts help users understand what they can ask the AI agent to do.

{{#if existingPrompts}}
## Previous Example Prompts

The user has seen these examples before:

{{{existingPrompts}}}

**IMPORTANT**: Generate a COMPLETELY NEW set of examples. Do not reuse or slightly modify the previous prompts. Think of fresh, different ways to demonstrate the agent's capabilities based on the current vault content.
{{/if}}

## Task

Generate 3-4 actionable example prompts that would be useful for this specific vault. These should:
- Be directly relevant to the vault's content and organization
- Demonstrate different agent capabilities (search, creation, research, organization)
- Use actual topics, folders, or tags from the vault
- Be specific and actionable, not generic
{{#if existingPrompts}}
- Be DIFFERENT from the previous examples shown above - show new ways to use the agent
{{/if}}

## Output Format

Return ONLY a JSON array with this structure:

```json
[
  {"icon": "search", "text": "Find all notes about [specific topic from vault]"},
  {"icon": "file-plus", "text": "Create a summary of [specific content type]"},
  {"icon": "globe", "text": "Research [vault-relevant topic] and create notes"},
  {"icon": "folder-tree", "text": "Organize [specific folder/section] by [relevant criteria]"}
]
```

Available icons: 'search', 'file-plus', 'globe', 'folder-tree', 'link', 'tag', 'calendar',
'book-open', 'lightbulb', 'sparkles'

## Guidelines

- Be specific to THIS vault's content - reference actual folders, topics, or tags you see
- Make prompts actionable and clear
- Vary the icon types to show different capabilities
- Keep text concise but descriptive
- **Use plain natural language** - do NOT use wiki link syntax like [[note name]]
- Reference notes, folders, and topics by name without brackets or special markdown syntax
- Write prompts as you would speak them naturally
- Return ONLY the JSON array, no additional text

Now analyze the vault structure and content provided below and generate the example prompts.
