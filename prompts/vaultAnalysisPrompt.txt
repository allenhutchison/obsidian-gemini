You are analyzing an Obsidian vault to generate initial context for the AGENTS.md file.
This file will provide persistent context to AI agents about the vault's structure,
organization, key topics, and purpose.

Your task is to analyze the vault structure and content provided to you and generate
comprehensive, helpful content for each of the following sections:

## Instructions

1. **Vault Overview**: Provide a 2-3 sentence description of what this vault appears to
   be used for based on the folder structure, file names, and any content you can see.
   Be specific about the domain or purpose (e.g., "personal knowledge base for software
   development", "research vault for academic papers on machine learning", "project
   management for a startup", etc.).

2. **Organization**: Describe how the vault is organized. Include:
   - Main folder structure and what each folder contains
   - Any obvious organizational patterns (by topic, by date, by project, etc.)
   - How notes appear to be linked or connected
   - Any special organizational schemes you notice (MOCs, daily notes, zettelkasten, etc.)

3. **Key Topics**: List the main topics or themes present in this vault. These should be:
   - Specific and concrete (not generic)
   - Based on actual folder names, file names, and content
   - Organized by importance or frequency
   - Formatted as a bulleted list

4. **User Preferences**: Based on the writing style, note structure, and organization,
   infer any preferences the user has for how the agent should behave. This might include:
   - Preferred writing style (formal vs. casual)
   - Level of detail in responses
   - Preferred note-taking patterns
   - Any obvious conventions to follow
   If you cannot infer clear preferences, write: "(Preferences will be learned over time)"

5. **Custom Instructions**: Based on the vault's purpose and organization, suggest any
   vault-specific instructions for the agent. For example:
   - Special handling for certain types of notes
   - Conventions for linking or tagging
   - Any domain-specific knowledge that would be helpful
   If no specific instructions are needed, write: "(No specific instructions yet)"

## Output Format

Return your analysis as a JSON object with the following structure:

```json
{
  "vaultOverview": "...",
  "organization": "...",
  "keyTopics": "...",
  "userPreferences": "...",
  "customInstructions": "..."
}
```

Each field should contain well-formatted Markdown text (including bullet points, emphasis,
etc. where appropriate). The content should be helpful and specific to this vault, not
generic boilerplate.

## Important Guidelines

- Be specific and concrete - avoid generic statements
- Base your analysis on actual evidence from the vault
- If information is limited, acknowledge that and provide what you can
- Write from the perspective of helping future AI agents understand this vault
- Use proper Markdown formatting for readability
- Keep descriptions concise but informative

Now analyze the vault structure and content provided below and generate the AGENTS.md content.
